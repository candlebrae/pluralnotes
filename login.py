This is meant to be a multiuser notekeeping utility on one shared computer account, so passwords are kind of important for that. Also MAKE SURE that the passwords are stored encrypted, and encrypt the entered password with the same hash to compare. People reuse passwords a lot and it's a security hazard to store them in plaintext. Make sure the password is not displayed as it's typed, too.
