Pluralnotes is a simple, terminal-based notebook utility designed with plural people in mind. It allows you to create multiple users on the same OS user, making it easy to keep several people's notes separate without ever logging off on the OS level. It includes a shared directory for keeping group notes or communicating, and an archive directory for the notes of deleted users.

Notes can be created with your preferred editor, edited, deleted, viewed, and searched. They can also be exported as a ZIP file for easy backups. The default text editors are nano for Un*x operating systems and Notepad for Windows (as Windows unfortunately lacks a default command line editor), but this easily can be changed to suit your preferences in the settings.

Users can be added, renamed, deleted, and searched through. There is no upper limit to the number of users you can have other than your disk's storage space. Users each have their own personal directory for personal notes in addition to the shared and archived notes directories.

Pluralnotes is written in Python 3. It should theoretically run on any computer with the required modules and dependencies installed; however, this utility has not been tested on non-Linux operating systems and may not work.

Can be run from source with <code>python (path to pluralnotesapp.py)</code>. Executable version incoming as soon as I can figure out how to do that.
